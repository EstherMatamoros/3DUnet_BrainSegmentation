**3D-VNET**

The Methodology is as follows: 

1. Preprocessing and Data Augmentation
   
• Data Augmentation and Preprocessing: Utilize TorchIO for data augmentation and preprocessing.
This includes random elastic deformation and affine transformations to simulate variations in the MRIs,
enhancing the model’s robustness. Additionally, intensity normalization is applied to ensure uniformity in
the input data.

• Dataset Preparation: It includes functions for normalization, applying CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adap-
tive Histogram Equalization) for contrast enhancement, and resizing images to a uniform shape. The class
also supports random sampling from the dataset for training and validation.

2. Model Architecture - VNet
   
• Input Transition Block: Process the initial input image using 3D convolutions, normalize it, and use an
activation function for non-linearity.

• DownTransition Blocks: These blocks progressively downsample the image, doubling the feature chan-
nels while reducing spatial dimensions. They consist of convolutions, batch normalization, activation func-
tions, and sometimes dropout for regularization.

• Bottleneck: The deepest layer in the network, crucial for capturing the most abstract features of the
image.

• UpTransition Blocks: These perform the reverse operation of DownTransition blocks. They upsample
the image back to its original size, concatenating features from the corresponding DownTransition block
(skip connections) to preserve high-resolution details.

• Output Transition Block: This final block converts the high-dimensional feature maps into the desired
number of output classes (e.g., CSF, WM, GM, background) using a convolutional layer.

3. Dice Loss Function

• It measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth, with a smooth term to
handle cases where the intersection is zero. The Dice score is calculated per class and averaged, making it
effective for imbalanced datasets

4. Training and Validation

• Training loop: The model processes batches of data, comparing its predictions to true values using a
loss function (DiceLoss). Gradients are computed based on this loss and used to update the model’s
parameters, optimizing its performance. A key feature here is gradient accumulation, which allows for
effective optimization over larger batches of data. This approach ensures more stable and robust updates
to the model’s weights.

• Validation loop: It calculates the validation loss, using the same loss function as in training but without
updating the model. If the validation loss improves, the model’s current state is saved, employing a
checkpointing mechanism. This process is vital for capturing the most effective model state during training.
